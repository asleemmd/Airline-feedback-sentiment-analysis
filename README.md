# Sentiment Analysis of Airline Feedback Data

This project focuses on sentiment analysis of airline customer feedback using deep learning models (LSTM and CNN) and interactive visualizations. The goal is to categorize feedback for actionable insights and improved customer experience.

📌**Project Overview:**

Collected and analyzed airline feedback data.

Applied Natural Language Processing (NLP) preprocessing: tokenization, stemming, and lemmatization.

Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand data patterns and distributions.

Developed LSTM and CNN models for sentiment classification.

Built an interactive Tableau dashboard for visualizing trends and insights.

🚀 **Key Features:**

✅ NLP preprocessing pipeline (tokenization, stemming, lemmatization)

✅ LSTM-based sentiment classifier (77% accuracy)

✅ CNN-based sentiment classifier (63% accuracy)

✅ Early stopping and learning rate reduction for better model performance

✅ Interactive Tableau dashboard with charts, maps, and dual-axis visualizations

✅ Categorization of feedback for actionable insights

🛠️ **Tools & Technologies:**

Python – Data preprocessing, model development
